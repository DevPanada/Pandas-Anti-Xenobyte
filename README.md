# Pandas-Anti-Xenobyte
This is a plugin for Minecraft 1.7.10, which can be used on Forge servers in order to get rid of the Xenobyte exploit client and prevent users from abusing your mods to gain an advantage over other players!

## How do I download this plugin?
Head over to the releases section and there will be a download link available, ensure that you also install the provided version of ProtocolLib onto your server (other versions may not work). Just a notice; unless specified otherwise within the change-log, that will always be the same version of ProtocolLib, you do not need to reinstall it every time you update the plugin.

## How does it work?
PAX works by filtering all packets sent to the server. This works because Xenobyte sends very specific packets to get their exploits to work.

## How do I install plugins on a Forge server? What was this plugin tested on?
You can achieve having both mods and plugins on your server by using a server jar such as Thermos or Cauldron.
Please note that this plugin has been tested on Thermos specifically, if you come across any issues on other server jars, feel free to report them, but a fix is not guaranteed to be released if the issue does not occur on Thermos or Cauldron.

## What modules are supported?
PAX supports the following modules:
  - CreativeGive
  - CacheGive
  - MalsisDoors
  - MalsisDoors (Radius)
